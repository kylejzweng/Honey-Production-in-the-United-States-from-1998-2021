# Honey Production in the United States from 1998-2021

In 2006, concern was raised across the globe regarding the rapid decline in the honeybee population. Large numbers of hives were lost to Colony Collapse Disorder, a phenomenon of disappearing worker bees resulting in the entire hive collapsing. This phenomenon is still unexplained and could be due to a variety of factors including climate change, pesticide use, and an unidentified colony disease. With this in mind, I wanted to look into the state of honey production in the United States.
